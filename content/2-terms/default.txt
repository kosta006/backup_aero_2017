**Aeroplate conditions**

We reserve the right to modify or terminate the service or your access to the service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your aeroplate account by requesting a removal of account via email - checkin@aeroplate.com.au. If we terminate your access to the service or you request termination of your account, your photos, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account, but those materials and data will persist and appear within the service.

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change our terms of use. You should review these terms of use and any updated terms before using the service. The updated terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated terms, and will apply to your use of the service from that point forward. These terms of use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the updated terms.

We reserve the right to refuse access to the service to anyone for any reason at any time.

We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.

We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor content or accounts containing content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these terms of use.

You agree that aeroplate is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Aeroplate reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you submit or post content or any personal or other information.

You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the service.

We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the service via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with aeroplate’s express consent).

**Rights**

Aeroplate does not claim ownership of any content that you post on or through the service. Instead, you hereby grant to aeroplate a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the content that you post on or through the service.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the content posted by you on or through the service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these terms of use; (ii) the posting and use of your content on or through the service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of content you post on or through the service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these terms of use in your jurisdiction.

The service contains content owned or licensed by aeroplate (“aeroplate content”). Aeroplate content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and aeroplate, aeroplate owns and retains all rights in the aeroplate content and the service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the aeroplate content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the aeroplate content.

The aeroplate name and logo are trademarks of aeroplate, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of aeroplate, except in accordance with our brand guidelines. Please contact us to see these brand guidelines - checkin@aeroplate.Com.Au. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of aeroplate, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from aeroplate.
Although it is aeroplate’s intention for the service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Content removed from the service may continue to be stored by aeroplate, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, aeroplate encourages you to maintain your own backup of your content. In other words, aeroplate is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the service for the purposes of content backup or storage. Aeroplate will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the services, or the loss of any content. You also acknowledge that the internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of content or other information may not be secure.

You agree that aeroplate is not responsible for, and does not endorse, content posted within the service. Aeroplate does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any content. If your content violates these terms of use, you may bear legal responsibility for that content.

Any content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with aeroplate is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any content does not place aeroplate in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your content. None of your content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of aeroplate, and aeroplate will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any content you provide.

**Reporting copyright and other IP violations**

Please treat other people and their IP with respect.

**Disclaimer of warranties**

The service, including, without limitation, aeroplate content, is provided on an “as is”, “as available” and “with all faults” basis. To the fullest extent permissible by law, neither aeroplate nor its parent company nor any of their employees, managers, officers or agents (collectively, the “aeroplate parties”) make any representations or warranties or endorsements of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, as to: (a) the service; (b) the aeroplate content; (c) user content; or (d) security associated with the transmission of information to aeroplate or via the service. In addition, the aeroplate parties hereby disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, title, custom, trade, quiet enjoyment, system integration and freedom from computer virus.

The aeroplate parties do not represent or warrant that the service will be error-free or uninterrupted; that defects will be corrected; or that the service or the server that makes the service available is free from any harmful components, including, without limitation, viruses. The aeroplate parties do not make any representations or warranties that the information (including any instructions) on the service is accurate, complete, or useful. You acknowledge that your use of the service is at your sole risk. The aeroplate parties do not warrant that your use of the service is lawful in any particular jurisdiction, and the aeroplate parties specifically disclaim such warranties. Some jurisdictions limit or do not allow the disclaimer of implied or other warranties so the above disclaimer may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdiction’s law is applicable to you and these terms of use.

By accessing or using the service you represent and warrant that your activities are lawful in every jurisdiction where you access or use the service.

The aeroplate parties do not endorse content and specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability to any person or entity for any loss, damage (whether actual, consequential, punitive or otherwise), injury, claim, liability or other cause of any kind or character based upon or resulting from any content.
Limitation of liability; waiver

Under no circumstances will the aeroplate parties be liable to you for any loss or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, for any direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental or consequential losses or damages) that are directly or indirectly related to: (a) the service; (b) the aeroplate content; (c) user content; (d) your use of, inability to use, or the performance of the service; (e) any action taken in connection with an investigation by the aeroplate parties or law enforcement authorities regarding your or any other party’s use of the service; (f) any action taken in connection with copyright or other intellectual property owners; (g) any errors or omissions in the service’s operation; or (h) any damage to any user’s computer, mobile device, or other equipment or technology including, without limitation, damage from any security breach or from any virus, bugs, tampering, fraud, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer line or network failure or any other technical or other malfunction, including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data, work stoppage, accuracy of results, or computer failure or malfunction, even if foreseeable or even if the aeroplate parties have been advised of or should have known of the possibility of such damages, whether in an action of contract, negligence, strict liability or tort (including, without limitation, whether caused in whole or in part by negligence, acts of god, telecommunications failure, or theft or destruction of the service). In no event will the aeroplate parties be liable to you or anyone else for loss, damage or injury, including, without limitation, death or personal injury. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. In no event will the aeroplate parties total liability to you for all damages, losses or causes or action exceed one hundred united states dollars ($100.00).

You agree that in the event you incur any damages, losses or injuries that arise out of aeroplate’s acts or omissions, the damages, if any, caused to you are not irreparable or sufficient to entitle you to an injunction preventing any exploitation of any web site, service, property, product or other content owned or controlled by the aeroplate parties, and you will have no rights to enjoin or restrain the development, production, distribution, advertising, exhibition or exploitation of any web site, property, product, service, or other content owned or controlled by the aeroplate parties.

Aeroplate is not responsible for the actions, content, information, or data of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties.

The effective date of these terms of use is October 20, 2017.
